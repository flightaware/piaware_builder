  * Report piaware image type correctly for package installs where there
    is more than one package matching 'piaware*'; this fixes the available

  * Support for running piaware directly on a Radarcape (receiver type
    "radarcape-local"); a version of piaware configured to use this will be
    included in future Radarcape software releases.

      ACAS RA reports when they change
    * Report magnetic heading, IAS, TAS, GNSS altitude, ident source, category
      where available

  * When upgrading, try harder to recover from interrupted upgrades and
    dependency problems
  * Allow config files to have different EOL conventions when writing them out.
  * Set /boot/piaware-config.txt to use CRLF EOL convention
  * If piaware exits with an unrecoverable error (e.g. login failure), don't
    restart it
  * If the exec of a fork-and-exec fails, kill the child process abruptly
    rather than letting tcl exit normally, to avoid interfering with any
    inherited file descriptors. (Mostly affects non-Debian systems e.g. Arch)
  * Patch cxfreeze to support building with Python 3.5

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Fri, 19 Aug 2016 14:00:48 +0100

piaware (3.0.3) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix a case where piaware could hang while doing a TLS handshake with
    adept if the network failed at the wrong time.
  * Ensure we force updated config files to disk immediately, so that a
    badly-timed crash is less likely to toast data. (If it's living on a
    FAT filesystem, we can't guarantee that, but we can reduce the window)

  * Upgrades are now handled via an apt repository and apt-get, rather than
    by directly downloading individual packages.
  * IPv6 support
  * Support getting receiver position information from a local gpsd
  * Write the receiver location to an environment file for use by dump1090
  * Moved logs to /var/log/piaware.log, with log rotation (either directly,
    or via systemd)
  * Write a status file to /run/piaware/status.json for use in health monitoring
  * Many smaller bugfixes and robustness improvements

piaware (2.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update to mlat-client 0.2.4:
    * Fix exception reporting when using cxfreeze.
    * Periodically report server synchronization status.
    * Report Mode S vs ADS-B aircraft counts.
    * Report UDP statistics to the server so it can notice UDP message loss.

  * Move all helpers (faup1090, fa-mlat-client) to /usr/lib/piaware/helpers.

  * Always use the packaged helpers, don't try $PATH.

  * Pass --stdout to faup1090 to provoke an error if it's an old version that
    doesn't write to stdout.

  * Report the versions of installed dump1090 packages on login.

  * Grab a lock on the piaware pidfile to avoid ever running two copies.

  * Filter mlat results if they somehow get looped back to faup1090 without
    the timestamp that identifies them as being mlat results.

  * Fix piaware-status when a non-English locale is used. (github issue #22)

  * Change the default mlat results port to 30104, so that it will not
    automatically connect to a non-mlat-aware dump1090. If you do want to
    connect to a non-mlat-aware dump1090 listening on the default port 30004,
    you can do this via "piaware-config -mlatResultsFormat
    beast,connect,localhost:30004". Please be careful that mlat results do
    not get forwarded to places that don't want to see them if you do this.
    (github issue #24)

  * Add -show option to piaware usage. (github pull request #23)

  * Update failsafe FlightAware server IPs to reflect the servers currently
    in use. Only use the failsafes if the connection to piaware.flightaware.com
    actually fails outright twice.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Mon, 28 Sep 2015 00:00:39 +0100

piaware (2.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add piaware-config -mlatResultsFormat, which gives control over the
    format(s) and ports that mlat results are provided on.

  * Use fa-mlat-client 0.2.3 which includes bugfixes for Basestation-format
    result output.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Thu, 09 Jul 2015 12:29:23 +0100

piaware (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Always use the version of faup1090 packaged with piaware to do message
    translation from the raw form provided by dump1090 et al; don't rely on
    the translation rules provided by anything listening on port 10001.

  * Pass the receiver location specified via the FlightAware website to
    faup1090 so that it is available for position decoding.

  * Update fa-mlat-client to support display of multilateration results
    returned from the FlightAware servers. The default configuration will
    convert these results to synthetic Beast-format messages and pass them
    to the local dump1090 on port 30004 for display on the local map.
    This may be disabled by "piaware-config -mlatResults 0".

  * Report CPU load in periodic health messages.

  * Preserve the timestamp that faup1090 provides in aircraft updates; this
    may be some time in the past if the report used older data. Separately
    report the time that the report was forwarded to FlightAware. This helps
    the FlightAware servers put the right time information on reports that
    have slightly stale (up to 30s old) data.

  * Tweaks to piaware's self-restart to hopefully be more robust and avoid
    leaving duplicate piaware processes around.

piaware (2.0-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Use faup1090 from dump1090-mutability. As dump1090-mutability makes many
    decoding decisions differently to the previous version of faup1090, and
    there are additional changes to the rules for when positions are emitted,
    you may see changes to the number of positions recorded by FlightAware.
  * Change connection buffering to avoid triggering Nagle's algorithm all the
    time.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Sun, 28 Jun 2015 12:08:34 +0100

piaware (2.0-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Improve package version reporting.
  * Improve mlat client logging; propagage client messages back to FlightAware so
    they appear in the ADS-B stats page log window.
  * Be more selective about what dump1090 init.d script we pick when trying to
    restart it.
  * Use invoke-rc.d to invoke init.d scripts, so we don't try to start a service
    that is disabled in the current runlevel.
  * Use cxfreeze to package the included copy of fa-mlat-client, which should
    improve portability between Raspbian versions.
  * Try to use the packaged mlat client if present; fall back to anything on
    $PATH if it's not present.

    running their own copies of dump1090 are advised to add "--gain -10" to
    their dump1090 command line arugments to obtain these same improvements.

  * Allow piaware to upgrade a package (piaware or dump1090) even if the
    current version can't be determined, like when it isn't installed.
    Since previous versions of the piaware bootable image shipped with
    dump1090 but dump1090 wasn't installed as a dpkg, piaware can't
    upgrade dump1090 through the manual or automatic installer.

  * Make piaware exit if it asks for a restart of itself but didn't die.

  * piaware's process ID number is now logged in piaware shutdown messages so
    the log isn't confusing if the old version is still exiting while the new
    one is already running.  (People upgrading from 1.19-3 will still see the
    potentially confusing messages; future upgrades from 1.20-1 will have
    clearer log messages.)

  * When piaware is looking for a dump1090 control script in /etc/init.d, make
    sure it prefers like fadump1090.sh to fadump1090.sh.dpkg-old.

  * Bug fix to make renaming /tmp/piaware.out to /tmp/piaware.out.yesterday to
    be more likely to occur on the UTC day boundary.

piaware (1.19-3) stable; urgency=medium

  * The 1.19-2 package was corrupted.  We always bump the version for every
    change due to CDN caching and whatnot.

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Tue, 30 Dec 2014 22:32:41 +0000

piaware (1.19-2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Compress the ADS-B messages, not just the non-ADS-B messages.

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Tue, 30 Dec 2014 21:02:44 +0000

piaware (1.19-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * New compression techniques reduce upstream bandwidth by 2/3rds without
    filtering any additional messages.

  * Disconnect from the server after many unrecognized server messages.

  * Report full version when running piaware -v to get version number.

  * Remove raspi-copies-and-fills from dependencies.  This makes the piaware
  Debian package compatible with more systems not based on Raspberry Pi.

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Sun, 28 Dec 2014 19:41:14 +0000

piaware (1.18-2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Principally this release is to bump the version number because the
    1.18-1 SD card image zip file was corrupt.

  * Reload adept config on update request in case piaware-config has been
    run and used to change something since piaware last started.

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Tue, 19 Nov 2014 17:52:42 +0000

piaware (1.18-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix "too many nested evaluations" error on systems without an eth0 device.

  * Include full piaware version (like 1.18-1 vs just 1.18) in login message.

  * Cache the mac address once it is known, for performance.

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Tue, 18 Nov 2014 20:18:03 +0000

piaware (1.17-2) stable; urgency=high

  * Fix bug in reconnecting after receiving an unrecognized message
    from the server.

  * Get a mac address from alternate source like wlan0 if no eth0 is present

  * Don't invoke rpi-update as part of a full update.

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Tue, 18 Nov 2014 00:44:21 +0000

piaware (1.17-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Disconnect/reconnect after detecting an error in a server message.
    Although we don't believe the runaway logging is caused by a server
    message, whatever the cause this should interrupt the runaway.

  * After disconnecting from the server wait 60 seconds before reconnecting.
    Again the goal here mainly is to slow things down.

  * Don't continue through the server message handler if we get an error
    reading from the server socket.

  * Don't try to log errors about messages theoretically received from the
    server, back to the server.

  * Add a -showtraffic option to piaware to aid debugging.

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Sat, 15 Nov 2014 15:46:30 +0000

piaware (1.16-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Reworked problem detection and restart logic: Piaware will now reliably
  attempt to restart dump1090 if no messages are received in an hour and
  piaware can find a startup script for dump1090 in /etc/init.d to restart it
  with.

  * Piaware will now attempt to start dump1090 if no ADS-B producer program
    is seen listening for connections on port 30005 (the "Beast" binary
    data port) for more than six minutes.

  * Most piaware messages logged locally are now also forwarded to
    FlightAware.  This will greatly help with debugging and users will
    soon be able to retrieve the last few hours of log messages via
    the FlightAware website.

  * New remote update capability for updating Raspbian and piaware.
  Automatic and manual updates are supported.  Both can be enabled or
  disabled on the device using piaware-config and auto updates can be
  disabled by the user through the FlightAware website.  If enabled
  the user will be able to issue manual updates through the FlightAware
  website, updating PiAware, other Debian packages, and the operating
  system and boot firmware as well as rebooting and restarting piaware
  and dump1090.

  * If the connection is lost with the FlightAware server then the reconnect
  interval is randomized between 60 and 120 seconds rather than hard-set at
  60 seconds to ease the server load when the adept server is restarted and
  a thousand plus piaware hosts all reconnect at the same time

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Fri, 30 Oct 2014 13:44:36 +0000

piaware (1.15-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Piaware will now attempt to restart dump1090 if no messages are
  received in an hour.

  * Multiple adept servers are now tried, round-robin.  The IP of the
  FlightAware server is now listed as well as the hostname.

  This allows connection in some cases where there are DNS problems
  on the local host.

  * Some addition versions of Linux are now supported.
  (thanks to github user brookst (Tim Brooks) for this)

piaware (1.14-2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix faup1090 bug introduced by recent service table fixes that made
    it to open a listening socket on the Beast port, which was fatal to
    faup1090 working properly.

  * Reworked traffic checks and timing of traffic report to keep the
    traffic report from interacting negatively with the traffic checks.

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Thu, 09 Oct 2014 08:40:08 +0000

piaware (1.14-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * faup1090 now exits if it loses its connection.

  Before this if dump1090 restarted for some reason then faup1090 would sit
  there idefinitely and passing no data to piaware, even after dump1090
  came back.  Hat tip to Oliver Jowett (github user "mutability") for the fix.

  * faup1090 services table bug fix

  A mistake in how the services table was defined in faup1090 caused faup1090
  to go past the end of the table when initializing and manipulating the
  TCP listening port.  It's a wonder it didn't cause a coredump.
  Hat tip again to Oliver Jowett for pointing out the bug...

  * Certificate validation failures on some other Linux systems' version of
    OpenSSL have been fixed.  Hat tip to John Carroll (FA user johncarroll944)
    for the fix.

  * Tcllauncher updated to version 1.5

  * Picked up numerous upstream dump1090 improvements and bug fixes, mostly
    by Oliver Jowett, through Malcolm Robb's dump1090 on github:

  * Improved client EOF handling.

  * Check if bit correction happened before bailing out due to a bad CRC.

  * Prefer to use global CPR decoding where possible.

  * Add --stats-every option, add sample block counters

  * Better error reporting if dump1090 is unable to bind a listening port.

piaware (1.13-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * piaware can now login without a FlightAware user's username and password
    having been pre-configured on the Raspberry Pi.

  * Stop shipping librtlsdr as faup1090 doesn't need it.

  * Properly install non-executable files without executable bit set.

  * piaware package is now digitally signed with a FlightAware developers key.

  * Almost all Debian package "lintian" complaints have been fixed.

  * Fix typo in faup1090 lost-connection message (thanks to github
    user saiarcot895).

  * All programs installed by piaware (piaware, piaware-config, piaware-status
    and faup1090) now have manual pages.

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Mon, 30 Sep 2014 12:49:09 +0000

piaware (1.12) stable; urgency=medium

  * Piaware 1.12 will correctly report version 1.12.  1.11 reported 1.10
  and caused a fair bit of confusion.  Sorry.

  * When piaware is up and successfully receiving and forwarding messages it
  should now log only the every-five-minutes traffic summary.

  * Any failure to determine the local IP address should no longer cause
  problems.

  * A few log messages shortened by having them not identify the function that
  issued them.

  * The net-tools package is now a prerequisite for PiAware.  This comes
  installed by default on Raspberry Pi / Raspbian but may help people trying
  to get PiAware working on other versions of Linux.

  * If piaware can't determine the local machine's MAC address then it aborts
  at startup.  This should only be relevant to people running PiAware on
  something other than Raspberry Pi / Raspbian as other versions of Linux may
  not provide the expected method piaware uses to figure that out.

piaware (1.11) stable; urgency=medium

  * Piaware now provides (hopefully) much more understandable log messages.
    For instance, while the prior message might have been
        reaped child 18593 SIG SIGHUP
    The new message is
    	the system confirmed that process $pid exited after receiving a hangup signal

  * Piaware Now logs the number of ADS-B messages received in the reporting
  interval (5 minutes) as well as cumulative, which makes it easier to see
  how many messages you are getting without having to do arithmetic in your
  head.

  * When piaware is asked by the system to shutdown, its log messages now says
  that in a more clear way.

  * cryptic "not-connected-yet" logged in some cases as a message source
  replaced by the hopefully less cryptic
  "(not currently connected to an adsb source)", which may be true when
  we have been connected but are no longer.

  * we now log when we send a hangup signal and what process we are sending it to

  * Raise time limit before reconnecting for no msgs

    Previously after five minutes if it hadn't received any messages piaware
    would kill and restart faup1090 and reconnect to it in order to get it
    to reconnect to dump1090 or modesmixer or whatnot, just in case there
    was a problem with the connection.

    FlightAware user "fill" pointed out that in off hours it will be common for
    many receivers to not see any messages for more than five minutes.

    The timeout is raised to one hour and the log message now better explains
    what's going on:

    "no new messages received in $secondsSinceLast seconds, it might just be
    that there haven't been any aircraft nearby but I'm going to possibly
    restart faup1090 and definitely reconnect, just in case there's a problem
    with the current connection..."

piaware (1.10) stable; urgency=medium

  * At midnight UTC, renames /tmp/piaware.out to /tmp/piaware.out.yesterday
  and starts a new /tmp/piaware.out

  * Local IP address is sent in login and health messages.  With server-side
  software that has yet to be written it'll provide a way for people to
  figure out the local IP that their Pi is on.

  * Bug fixed where it would log not-connected-yet when it was connected.

  * The /etc/init.d/piaware script now references the full path to
  start-stop-daemon and piaware-config, making PiAware work with
  DarkBasic Minimal Rasbarian and being a better practice, anyway.
  (Hat Tip to FlightAware user PeterHR for the report.)

  * Periodic alive messages from the server are no longer logged after
  the first one is received.

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Sat,  6 Sep 2014 05:27:58 +0000

piaware (1.9) stable; urgency=medium

  * piaware now figures out whatever program is serving beast data on
  port 30005 and is cool with it

  * new piaware-status program to inspect and report on the running state
  of the piaware toolchain

  * piaware will now disconnect and reconnect from the ADS-B source and
  restart faup1090 if messages aren't received for a while

  * piaware now receives "alive" messages from the server (release 1.9 and
  above) and will disconnect and reconnect after a timeout if one is not
  received

  * piaware server now disconnects if it hasn't received anything from piaware
  for quite a while

  * piaware server now tells piaware when it is going down before it
  intentionally disconnects

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Sat, 30 Aug 2014 14:15:54 +0000

piaware (1.8) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix traceback in piaware traffic report when no traffic has occurred.

  * Fix traceback in connect retry code when piaware has trouble connecting
  to FlightAware

 -- FlightAware Developers <adsb-devs@flightaware.com>  Sat, 30 Aug 2014 18:38:07 +0000

piaware (1.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove the Tk toolkit as a dependency.

  * Login failures are now successfully reported back to piaware and logged
  in /tmp/piaware.out.

  * Piaware will exit after a login failure as manual intervention to change
  the user name and/or password is probably required.

  * Piaware now starts receiving data sooner after startup, typically within
  about ten seconds.

  * Fix bug in keep_trying_to_connect that would cause it not to.

  * When piaware is trying to reconnect to FlightAware after losing its server
  conenction, its log messages are much more clear / descriptive.

  * Failure of piaware to initially connect to FlightAware within ten seconds
  resulted in piaware terminating.  Failure of piaware to reconnect
  after losing a connection could result in a stuck piaware
  that was running but wouldn't reconnect or forward messages.
  Piaware now retries connections after connection failures both at startup
  and after it has successfully connected.

  * Piaware now logs in one log message the number of messages received from
  dump1090 and the number of messages sent to FlightAware, one minute after
  startup and every five minutes thereafter.  Previously it logged for
  each thousand messages received and thousand messages sent the frequency
  of which could be highly variable based on location and time of day.
